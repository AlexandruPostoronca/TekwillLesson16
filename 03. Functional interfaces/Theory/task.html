<h2>Functional interfaces</h2>
<p>In this topic, you will learn a new concept called <strong>functional interfaces</strong>. This is vital knowledge
    because these kinds of interfaces allow developers to use functional programming over the concepts from OOP and, in
    a sense, connect both these worlds together. It is functional interfaces that make it possible to use lambda
    expressions, method references, and other functional stuff. We suppose that you are already familiar with
    interfaces, lambda expressions, and anonymous classes. Now we are going to show you how they are all connected with
    each other.</p>

<h4>Functions and interfaces</h4>
<p>If an interface contains only a<strong> single abstract method</strong> (such an interface is sometimes called a
    <strong>SAM type</strong>), it can be considered as a function. In addition to standard ways of implementing
    interfaces through inheritance or anonymous classes, these interfaces can be implemented by using a lambda
    expression or a method reference.Here is a clone of the standard <code>Function&lt;T, R&gt;</code> interface that
    demonstrates the basic idea:</p>
<pre><code>@FunctionalInterface
interface Func&lt;T, R&gt; { 
    R apply(T val); // single abstract method
}</code></pre>
<div class="alert alert-primary">The annotation <code>@FunctionalInterface</code> is used to mark functional
    interfaces and to raise a compile-time error if an interface doesn't satisfy the requirements of a functional
    interface. The use of this annotation is not mandatory but recommended.
</div>
<p>The <code>Func&lt;T, R&gt;</code> interface meets the requirements to be a functional interface because it has a
    single
    <code>apply</code> method, which takes a value of the type <code>T</code> and returns a result of the type
    <code>R</code>.Here is an example of a lambda expression that implements this custom interface:</p>
<pre><code>Func&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; multiplier10 = n -&gt; n * 10;
System.out.println(multiplier10.apply(5)); // 50</code></pre><p>In a similar way, all standard functions can be
    represented as functional interfaces, including <code>BiFunction&lt;T, U, R&gt;</code>. The concept of functional
    interfaces is another way to model functions instead of using regular methods.It is worth noticing, that <code>static</code>
    and <code>default</code> methods are allowed in functional interfaces because these methods are not abstract:</p>
<pre><code>@FunctionalInterface
interface Func&lt;T, R&gt; { 
    R apply(T val);

    static void doNothingStatic() { }

    default void doNothingByDefault() { } 
}</code></pre><p>This interface is a valid functional interface as well.</p>

<h4>Implementing functional interfaces</h4>
<p>There are several ways to implement a functional interface. As you know from the previous OOP theory, it is
    impossible to directly create an instance of an interface. Then what should we do?First of all, we should implement
    the interface to create a concrete class. Then, create an instance of this concrete class. The main requirement is
    to implement the <code>apply</code> method to get a concrete behavior.Let's consider three ways to do it.<strong>1)
        Anonymous classes.</strong> Of course, like any other interface, a functional interface can be implemented by
    using an anonymous class or regular inheritance.To implement a functional interface let's create an anonymous class
    and override the <code>apply</code> method. The overridden method calculates the square of a given value:</p>
<pre><code>Func&lt;Long, Long&gt; square = new Func&lt;Long, Long&gt;() {
    @Override
    public Long apply(Long val) {
        return val * val;
    }
};

long val = square.apply(10L); // the result is 100L</code></pre><p>In this example, we model a math function that
    squares a given value. This code works perfectly but it is a bit unclear since it contains a lot of extra characters
    to perform a single line of useful code.We won't give you an example of a regular class because it has the same (and
    even more) disadvantages.<strong>2) Lambda expressions.</strong> A functional interface can also be implemented and
    instantiated by using a lambda expression.Here is a lambda expression that has the same behavior as the anonymous
    class above:</p>
<pre><code>Func&lt;Long, Long&gt; square = val -&gt; val * val; // the lambda expression

long val = square.apply(10L); // the result is 100L</code></pre><p>The type of the functional interface (left) and the
    type of the lambda (right) are the same from a semantic perspective. Parameters and the result of a lambda
    expression correspond to the parameters and the result of <strong>a single abstract method </strong>of the
    functional interface.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">The code that creates a lambda expression may look as if the object of an interface
    type is created. As you know, it is impossible. Actually, the Java compiler automatically creates a special
    intermediate class that implements the functional interface and then creates an object of this class rather than an
    object of an interface type. The name of such a class may look like
    <code>Functions$$Lambda$14/0x0000000100066840</code> or something similar.
</div>
<p><strong>3) Method references.</strong>Another way to implement a functional interface is by using method references.
    In this case, the number and type of arguments and the return type of a method should match the number and types of
    arguments and the return type of the single abstract method of a functional interface.Suppose, there is a method
    <code>square</code>that takes and returns a <code>long</code> value:</p>
<pre><code>class Functions {

    public static long square(long val) {
        return val * val;
    }
}</code></pre><p>The argument and the return type of this method fits the <code>Func&lt;Long, Long&gt;</code> functional
    interface. This means we can create a method reference and assign it to an object of the <code>Func&lt;Long, Long&gt;</code>
    type:</p>
<pre><code>Func&lt;Long, Long&gt; square = Functions::square;</code></pre><p>Keep in mind, that the compiler creates an
    intermediate hidden class that implements the <code>Func&lt;Long, Long&gt;</code> interface in a similar way to the
    case of lambda expressions.</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary">Usually, method references are more readable than the corresponding lambda
    expressions. Try to prefer this way of implementing and instantiating functional interfaces when possible.
</div>
